# smart-home-simulator
My first Python Project simulating a Smart Home System in the terminal. You can control lights, door locks, and more using basic Python logic. 

### 🛠️ Built With
- Python 3  
- Functions with parameters and return values  
- If-else statements  
- While loops  
- Basic input handling
